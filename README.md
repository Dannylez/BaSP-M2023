# Become a Software Professional 2023

This is my repository for the bootcamp of Radium Rocket: Become a Software Professional 2023 edition.
In the next weeks we will be working on a project named "Mega Rocket's Gym".
The idea of this project is to create a functional webpage for a gym in which both members and trainers feel comfortable using it.

## Week 01

Me and my team been working on Figma designing the web page, creating the canvas and connecting them. Me specifically, I've been working on the member profile, giving them options to edit their profile and change memberships.

## Week 02

In this week I'll be working on the HTML structure of the landpage with the design previously created.

## Week 03

This time I'll be working on the styles of the structure created last week using a reset.css and styles.css file trying to make a pixel perfect page.

## Week 04

This task consists of recreating the landing page styles again but with a responsive model taking priority on the mobile model (mobile first).
We will also be working on a new github feature called github pages, wich allows you to view the repository online, without having to download the content.
The Github pages for this week can be found on: https://dannylez.github.io/BaSP-M2023/Week-04/index.html

## Week 05

On this week I had to perform javascript exercises showing the results in the console and in alerts.
The exercises contained concepts such as:

<ol>
    <li>Variables and operators.</li>
    <li>Strings.</li>
    <li>Arrays.</li>
    <li>If else.</li>
    <li>For loops.</li>
    <li>Functions.</li>
</ol>

## Week 06

This week's task involved implementing validation criteria for a Login and Sign Up form in JavaScript. The following validation rules were used:

<ul>
    <li>Name: Only letters and should have more than 3 letters.</li>
    <li>Last name: Only letters and should have more than 3 letters.</li>
    <li>DNI: Only numbers and should have more than 7 digits.</li>
    <li>Date of birth: must be in the format dd/mm/yyyy, the user must be older than 12 years old, and must have been born after the year 1900.</li>
    <li>Phone number:Only numbers and should have exactly 10 digits.</li>
    <li>Address: At least 5 alphanumeric characters and a space in between.</li>
    <li>Location: Alphanumeric text and should have more than 3 letters.</li>
    <li>Postal code: Only numbers and should have between 4 and 5 digits.</li>
    <li>Email: Should have a valid email format.</li>
    <li>Password: Must include a mix of uppercase, lowercase and numbers and be at least 8 characters long.</li>
    <li>Repeat password: Must be equal to Password</li>
</ul>
The only input validated using Regex was the email input, and all inputs had type="text", except for password (type="password") and date of birth (type="date").
Both the login and sign up pages were created using previously learned skills of responsive HTML and CSS. Additionally, hamburger menu functionality was added to the landing page. Also, connections were made between the landing, sign up, and login pages. All of this can be found on this GitHub Pages: https://dannylez.github.io/BaSP-M2023/Week-06/views/index.html
