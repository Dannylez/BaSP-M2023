# Become a Software Professional 2023
In the next weeks we will be working on a project named "Mega Rocket's Gym".
The idea of this project is to create a functional webpage for a gym in which both members and trainers feel comfortable using it.

## Week 01
Me and my team been working on Figma designing the web page, creating the canvas and connecting them. Me specifically, I've been working on the member profile, giving them options to edit their profile and change memberships

## Week 02
In this week I'll be working on the HTML structure of the landpage with the design previously created.
